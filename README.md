# react-boilerplate-tv

This is an implementation of react-boilerplate taken from https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate

Mainly this boilerplate uses redux & redux-saga for state management & application side-effects. For detailed list of libraries please follow the react-boilerplate documentation

Changed the file structure by adding pages & styled-components folder in app

Also added typescript support for superior compile time checking (Thanks to https://itnext.io/add-typescript-to-react-boilerplate-project-332862b53fed)
